Academic/Job Position Finder with Python

Have you ever spent a lot of time finding related professors, their email addresses, research interests, etc., and manually copying this information into an Excel file to reach out and apply for academic positions at the right time?

I created a Colab-ready Python script that scrapes academic contact information from 50+ top-ranked global universities based on your research keywords â€” and exports everything to a clean Excel file.

ðŸ”¹ You provide:
Keywords related to your research interests
URLs of university department pages (fully editable and expandable)

ðŸ”¹ You get:
Professor name
University name
Email address
University profile link
LinkedIn
Matched research keywords

Whether you're looking for PostDoc, PhD, MSc/BSc, internship, or academic job opportunities, this tool helps you scale your outreach and save valuable time.

I had this idea, and I independently conceptualized and developed this tool, using ChatGPT to support the implementation and debugging process.

This is an initial version â€” feel free to improve or adapt it for your own goals.

Have ideas or feedback? I'd love to hear them.
